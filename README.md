# Prospective Students

## Useful information for prospective students

Thank you for your interest in our graduate programs. Admissions to the MSc and PhD programs in our Department are
managed centrally by an Admissions Committee. Information on the application process (including
minimum requirements, deadlines, etc.) can be found [here](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/graduate-admissions). 
I suggest that you also spare a few minutes to read through 
the [Frequently Asked Questions page](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/graduate-admissions-faqs).

I will not look at individual applications unless the Admissions Committee contacts me. If you are interested
in working under my supervsion, it is up to you to indicate so in the application package you submit.
It will help your case if you explain why you are interested in being my student, specifically. 
Identifying a problem or research topic of interest that aligns with my research and expertise is 
definitively a big plus.

I do not generally take visiting students (even fully self-funded). The exceptions are the cases where
there is a specific well-defined 
problem with which I can help. If you think you are in this latter category, 
please send me a detailed technical description
of the problem (identifying what I can contribute to solving it), and a tentative research plan for your visit.  
This does not guarantee that you will be invited, but you can be sure I will read
and consider your request carefully.

My papers can be found [here](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/users/matias-salibian-barrera), and most of my code
