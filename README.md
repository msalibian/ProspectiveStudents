# Prospective Students

## Useful information for prospective students

Thank you for your interest in our graduate programs. Admissions to the MSc and PhD programs in our Department are
managed centrally by an Admissions Committee. Information on the application process (including
minimum requirements, deadlines, etc.) can be found [here](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/graduate-admissions). 
I suggest that you also spare a few minutes to read through 
the [Frequently Asked Questions page](https://www.stat.ubc.ca/graduate-admissions-faqs).

I typically do not look at individual applications unless the Admissions Committee contacts me, and generally MSc
students do not have a supervisor until after they have completed two Terms of course 
work in our program. If you are interested in working under my supervsion, please indicate so in the application 
package you submit. It will help your case if you explain why you are interested in being specifically my student. 
Identifying a problem or area of interest that aligns closely with my research and expertise is 
definitively a big plus. 

I do not generally take visiting students (even fully self-funded). The exceptions are the cases where
there is a specific well-defined problem with which I can help. If you think you are in this latter 
category, please send me a detailed technical description of the problem (identifying what I can contribute to 
solving it), and a tentative research plan for your visit.  This does not guarantee that you will 
be invited, but you can be sure I will read and consider your request carefully.
